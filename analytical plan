Notes-

- show crime counts/data with different options: violent crime vs violent street crime
- shootings/shots fired 
- compare blocks? overlap? totally different
- block features under each option: ACS data, lots, 311, 911 call types, etc. (send to Luminosity)
- Need literature review on making sense of diusorder data and 311 data
- pd codes that comprise top blocks
